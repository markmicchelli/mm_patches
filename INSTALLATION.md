# INSTALLATION

In order to use these patches (in particular, certain `mm_effects`), the
following externals must be downloaded:

1. [fiddle~.mxo](https://github.com/v7b1/fiddle_64bit_version/releases) by Miller S. Puckette
2. [Percolate](https://github.com/Cycling74/percolate) originally by Dan Trueman and Luke Dubois
3. [Tilde](https://github.com/ramagottfried/tilde) by Rama Gottfried
4. [SuperVP](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/supervp-for-max/) by IRCAM

Once these are downloaded and placed in your search path, put the `mm_patches`
folder in the same search path.
