# mm_patchers

This folder contains the contents of my Max 8 Library, featuring abstractions
and bpatchers I use to develop my Max Projects.

- `mm_abstractions`: patches that produce or modify control signals
- `mm_effects`: bpatchers that modify an audio signal (audio in and out)
- `mm_generators`: bpatchers that produce an audio signal (only audio out)
- `mm_hardware`: patches and bpatchers that simplify connections to hardware devices
- `mm_utilities`: bpatchers that provide miscellaneous functionality (recording, timings, etc.)

To see these patches in action, check out my composition series
